Suppose in YourLiteralTest you have two unit tests
TestStringConstructor
TestBlobConstructor

When your run the binary, it will show:
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test cases.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from YourLiteralTest
[ RUN      ] YourLiteralTest.TestStringConstructor
[       OK ] YourLiteralTest.TestStringConstructor (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] YourLiteralTest.TestBlobConstructor
[       OK ] YourLiteralTest.TestBlobConstructor (0 ms)

The original question is how to setup break point or what is the function name for break point setup? Not how to use GDB. There are a bunch of tutorials about GDB. If they ask how to use gdb, he will not ask here. 

The answer should be 

"gdb ./helloword.x
break YourLiteralTest_TestStringConstructor_Test::TestBody" 

Not how to use GDB.
